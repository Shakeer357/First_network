In IoT networks, congestion can lead to increased latency, packet loss, and unnecessary energy consumption. This project proposes a Smart Congestion Control Management Framework designed for energy-constrained devices using Cisco Packet Tracer,  Firebase, and a Kodular-based mobile app.
The framework enables real-time traffic monitoring, where all IoT devices function normally during optimal conditions. However, during congestion, the system intelligently prioritizes traffic, ensuring that only high-priority devices (such as smart lights) remain active while others temporarily pause to conserve energy. This is achieved through priority-based packet handling, congestion detection, and cloud-based control.
By integrating network segmentation, energy-efficient data transmission, and real-time congestion alerts, this framework enhances IoT performance, optimizes energy usage, and ensures uninterrupted functionality of critical devices.
